## FAQ

### How do I change the settings?
Right [here](https://revadike.com/swi/settings/).

### How can I blacklist a domain?
Right [here](https://revadike.com/swi/settings/).

### Why are the ownership/wishlist icons not working or incorrect?
Make sure you are logged in to steam with the right account in your web browser and visit [this page](http://store.steampowered.com/dynamicstore/userdata/) and refresh until you can see all your data is loaded (you will see [this](https://i.imgur.com/ShKcuay.png) if it is not loaded). If that does not work, try factory reset.

### Why doesn't it work for me?
I don't know. Try factory reset. Otherwise, be sure to contact me and provide me the log/error from the JavaScript console, if there is any.
Post it [here](https://github.com/Revadike/SteamWebIntegration/issues).
